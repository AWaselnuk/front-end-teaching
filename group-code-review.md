# Group Code Review

Group code review is a great way to share knowledge across the FED team and get insight into how other FEDs work through
a Pull Request.

## Format

**Length:** 45 - 60 min

**Group Size:** 10 - 14

**Requirements:**

* Ability to understand basic JavaScript syntax. 
* Willingness to learn more about JavaScript.
* People bringing PRs should have a clear goal for the PR. We want to focus on code review not the validity of the PR.

**Preparation:**

* A couple of people should come ready with some PRs to review.
* For now, we will focus only on reviewing JavaScript code. 
* The focus will be on the clarity and quality of the code - we will avoid discussing the validity of the PR.
* Organizers should have a few people lined up with PRs to make sure there is code to review. 
* Organizers should also be conscious of keeping the whole group on track with the discussion.
* Take time to explore and explain JS concepts. The goal is to learn about JavaScript and programming - not to ship the PR fast.
