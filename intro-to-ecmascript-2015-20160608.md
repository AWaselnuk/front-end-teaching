# FED Workshop: Intro to EcmaScript 2015

**Length:** 2 hours
**Requirements:**

* You understand basic JavaScript syntax and concepts, for example, assigning variables or declaring functions.

## Topic

We will look at some of the most commonly used of the new EcmaScript 2015 features: `const` and `let`, and arrow function declarations.

## Workshop Content

### const vs let vs var

* Block scope vs function scope
* What do we mean by mutable? What do we mean by dereferencing? What is the difference?
* Show a code sample of each and practice throwing errors with const. Show the const allows mutations but not dereferencing.
* When to use which one.

### Arrow function syntax

* Show the syntax
* Show a common case for it
* Show the same thing in ES5 syntax and talk about bind
* When to use it?

## Further Learning

### To explore

* Getter and setter functions. They exist in JavaScript.
* Object freeze vs seal. What's the difference?
* What is `this` on an anonymous function?
* Why not pass in `this` as a function arg instead of using bind?

### Challenge

Go through the Shopify codebase and convert a JS or CoffeeScript module to ES2015.
